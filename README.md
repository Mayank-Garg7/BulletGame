## Description

The Space Invaders game is a browser-based game that allows players to control a spaceship to shoot down incoming waves of enemy spaceships and asteroids. It's a fun and nostalgic game that challenges your reflexes and shooting skills.

## Usage

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

3. Enjoy playing the game! Use the arrow keys (left and right) to move your spaceship, and press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the enemies.

## How to Play

- Use the **left arrow key** or **A key** to move the spaceship left.
- Use the **right arrow key** or **D key** to move the spaceship right.
- Press the **spacebar** to fire bullets at the enemies.
- Your goal is to eliminate all the enemy spaceships and asteroids without letting them reach the bottom of the screen.
- If an enemy spaceship or asteroid collides with your spaceship, you lose the game. You can restart the game by refreshing the page.
